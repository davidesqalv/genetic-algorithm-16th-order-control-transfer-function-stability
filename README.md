# Stabilizing a control 16th order transfer function with genetic algorithms
Stabilizing a 16th order control system with genetic algorithms, while also aiming for a 20% overshoot on 1 second after start


Using python Control and PyGAD libraries

The transfer function constant weights corresponded to the chromosome in the genetic algorithm, while the fitness function evaluates stability and proximity of the overshoot to being 20% at 1 second
